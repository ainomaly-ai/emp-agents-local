## What makes this framework different?

Tools integrations represent the most critical path forward for developers working with AI. As AI models continue to evolve and improve, the ability to effectively manage and control how these systems interact with external tools and services becomes increasingly important. The framework's primary focus is on providing developers with robust tools integration capabilities that enable precise control over AI system interactions.

While AI models themselves are powerful, their true potential is realized through carefully managed integrations with existing systems and services. This framework emphasizes the importance of tools management by providing a structured approach to defining, organizing, and controlling tool interactions. By focusing on tools integration management, developers can ensure their AI implementations are both powerful and predictable.

Security, reliability, and controlled deployment are key benefits of our tools-first approach. Through fine-grained control over what actions an AI can take and what data it can access, developers can carefully orchestrate AI capabilities within their applications. This approach enables responsible AI deployment while maintaining the flexibility needed to adapt to evolving AI technologies and integration requirements.


## Focus

We also have an explicit focus on tooling for blockchain integrated agents.  This framework is not opinionated exclusively for blockchain use cases, but we believe this is a critical area of development and will focus our tools integration on making agents that can work well with popular data feeds, blockchain protocols and social media platforms.  Blockchain agents also have a few expected capabilities:

**Onchain Actions**: Agents should be able to make onchain actions, such as sending transactions to a blockchain.
**Onchain Data**: Agents should be able to retrieve data from a blockchain.
**Social Interactions**: Agents should be able to interact with social media platforms.


I woul also include a few other capabilities that are more traditional data wrangling behaviors:

**Extract Data**: Agents should be able to extract data from a website or other source.
**Transform Data**: Agents should be able to transform data into a usable format.
**Load Data**: Agents should be able to load data into a database or other storage.


Since an agent will typically be working directly with text, because able to provide the information to the agent as a jsonnd or csv file allows the agent to work with the information directly.
